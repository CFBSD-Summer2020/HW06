## HW 06: Include a for loop and a function in your code.

### For HW06 I will be using a for loop and function on some of my western blot data before graphing. 

```{r}
#Loading packages

library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

#reading in dataset 

library(readxl)
Western_blot <- read_excel("~/Documents/Western blot data 7 2020.xlsx", 
    sheet = "R Data 2")

str(Western_blot)



#In the dataset, the expression levels need to be manipulated to be diplayed as a percent relative to the control:

#First, select data to work with:

Expression.nfkb <- Western_blot %>%
  select(Normalized.expression)


#Option 1: Manipulate data using a for loop:

for (i in Expression.nfkb){
  Expression.nfkb.loop <- Expression.nfkb/ 9.203333 * 100 #note: 9.203333 copied and pasted from data to normalize based on control 
}

colnames(Expression.nfkb.loop) <- c("Normalized.expression.percent")

#Option 2: Maniuplate data using a function:

function.to.percent <- function(x) {
  
  a <- x / 9.203333 
  b <- a * 100
  return(b)
}

Expression.nfkb.function <- function.to.percent(Expression.nfkb$Normalized.expression)


#Up to this point I could have used either method to manipulate data before graphing. I Will go ahead and graph my data using option 1. First, I need to joing the datasets. Factor to manually order barchart bars. 

NFKB <-cbind(Western_blot, Expression.nfkb.loop)

NFKB1 <- NFKB
factor(NFKB1$Treatment, levels = c("Control", "2_ATP", "6_ATP", "2_TGFB", "6_TGFB"))

#Graph:

ggplot(NFKB1, aes(Protein.name, Normalized.expression.percent, color = Treatment, fill = Treatment)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Treatment), stat = 'identity') +
  facet_wrap(~ Protein.name) +
  
#Adding labels to the graphs 
  
  labs(title = element_blank(), x = element_blank(), y = "Relative Expression") +
  
#Making the graph look nicer
  
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  
  theme_bw() +
  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14), axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = "black"), axis.title = element_text(size = 14), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) 
  
#I am unsure why my manual factoring of my Treatments did not apply to my graph ):   

```
