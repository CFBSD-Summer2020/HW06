This assignment felt impossible to do. Was not able to finish it, as I was unable to install the packages required to map the transcript_ids. It kept throwing some weird error when trying to install the packages. I was also unable to get a loop working that could correctly bind each table together from the list of tables. Instead I used an rbindlist function from the data.table package. My code can be found [here](HW06.Rmd)
