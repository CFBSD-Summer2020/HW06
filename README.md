# HW06
Due August 17th

As usual you can do your own thing for this HW, so long as it includes a for loop and a function. 

You will like find this HW prompt a bit difficult, I think. However, it will have some very good lessons for everyone and is a relevant example for people. Look at the [HW06.Rmd file](HW06.Rmd) for the full prompt, but it involves looking whether the H3K27M mutation in glioblastoma cell lines affect the transcription (mRNA) levels of 27 genes of interest. It involves you figuring out how to read in many datasets, do many statistical tests, creating a graphing function and graphing the results. 

That is all to say, you will read in 45 documents, map transcript IDs to symbols, do (at least) 27 statistical tests, and make 27 graphs. I was able to do it in about 50 lines of code (86 with some spacing and comments). If you want, try to meet or do it in less. Good luck. 

I was having trouble installing the three packages for mapping gene ids to gene symbols. R was telling me that my version of R studio doesn't support the packages but I am certain I have the most updated version of R. Or perhaps I am checking the version of my R Studio improperly? I remember having some confusion about this earlier, but I don't recall how I resolved it. I also am unsure whether I understand how to do this assignment generally. I found myself conceptually confused for the most part (rather than running into syntax issues like I normally do).
