# HW06
Due August 17th

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to finish the whole assignment. I got stuck at the graphing part. However, I think that everything up to and including the t-test part worked.  
**Here is the link to my [code](HW06.Rmd) and [markdown](HW06.md).**

As usual you can do your own thing for this HW, so long as it includes a for loop and a function. 

You will like find this HW prompt a bit difficult, I think. However, it will have some very good lessons for everyone and is a relevant example for people. Look at the [HW06.Rmd file](HW06.Rmd) for the full prompt, but it involves looking whether the H3K27M mutation in glioblastoma cell lines affect the transcription (mRNA) levels of 27 genes of interest. It involves you figuring out how to read in many datasets, do many statistical tests, creating a graphing function and graphing the results. 

That is all to say, you will read in 45 documents, map transcript IDs to symbols, do (at least) 27 statistical tests, and make 27 graphs. I was able to do it in about 50 lines of code (86 with some spacing and comments). If you want, try to meet or do it in less. Good luck.
